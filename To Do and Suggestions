Some ideas for extensions to add to the Shiny App, as well as what we are hoping to do next:

To Do:
1) Fix occurrences download function, update it to change along with user input
2) Seperate functions to generate plot and table
3) Put in geom_rect for geology timescale, colored by age
4) Update plot dimensions, text size, theme, etc to make it more readable
5) Fix "download occurrences" button so that it actually works and the user can download the occurrence data returned by the API
6) Create an icon for the app
7) Post as a web app, link on PBDB and Neotoma websites

Suggesitons from the workshop participants:
- Offer a widget to order taxa (by length of species longevity? by when it went extinct? by phylogenetic relationship?)
- Throw a dagger onto the taxa that are now extinct
- Color a portion of the bar to show the uncertainty on species occurrence data (likely near the end and beginning of the longevity)
- Timetree project - could include divergence dates (based on molecular data) to each species
- Change bars into violin plots for each species, with width proportional to density of occurrences (potential problem - huge bias for more recent taxa because of availability of rock record, may need to use a rarefaction function)
